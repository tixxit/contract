## Contract: URL Shortener

This is a simple example of a URL shortening service written with Spray, Akka,
and Berkeley DB. This is my first project using Spray, so it is really just a
learning experience for me.

### Running Contract

    $ sbt run

Then [go to the lovely UI](http://localhost:8080/).
